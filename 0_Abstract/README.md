# Abstract for wiper control system

The traditional wiper system requires driverâ€™s attention to switch on the wiper system during rainfall. Whereas in traffic condition,
driver should not be diverted by manual adjustment of switching the wiper system which may lead to accident. Probably 80% of
accidents happen due to the distraction of driver. In this scenario we need to design an automatic wiping on the wind screen during
rain so as to avoid distraction of driver. The existing automatic wiper system has false wiping just after the rainfall stops which
can be overcome by using proposed wiper system. Always just after the rainfall a few droplets on the existing water sensor will be
sustained until it is cleaned or inherently evaporated. These water drops make a connection between two grid lines to occur false
wiping. The advantage of proposed automatic wiper system is compared with the water sensor of existing automatic wiper system
after rainfall. The proposed system in this paper is more accurate and economically cheap which can be implemented in all low
and middle level vehicles. In order to avoid critical situation this automatic wiper system provides variable wiping speed based on
precipitation level. This automatic wiper system has low cost water sensor, Atmega8 microcontroller, Arduino Uno, LCD module
and wiper motor,power cable

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal by a converter (12) for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.
