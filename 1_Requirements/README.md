# Introduction
The wipers are individual controlled by two wiper switches on the P5 fwd overhead panel with the next selections:
*  INT – Intermittent operation, sweeps the wiper every 7 seconds.
* LOW – Low speed operation, sweeps the wiper ± 160 times per minute.
* HIGH – High speed operation, sweeps the wiper ± 250 times per minute.
* PARK – Stops wiper operation

  The windscreen of modern vehicles have a double curvature, which requires long articulated wiper blades with the ability to flex to the contour of the glass. Wiper systems generally use two wipe speeds to suit the driving conditions and also an intermittent wipe facility is incorporated.
A car wiper motor on a modern vehicle should be a high powered quiet unit operating on a current of 2 – 4 A. In the past, shunt-wound motors were used but now-a-days the permanent-magnet motor is commonly used.

# 4W'S & 1H

## what
It controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions

## Where
It is located underneath the dashboard,above the brake & accelerator pedal and
It is used in buses,cars,lorries,vans,etc

## When
The humidity or rain falls the wipers can be used

## Why
To clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times

## How
Wiper system in cars today use a rain sensor to detect the speed at which the raindrops are falling on the windsheild
